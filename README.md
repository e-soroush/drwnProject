This is my implementations under [darwin framework](http://drwn.anu.edu.au) for object detections. For more details please see the original repo.\n
My works include:
1. I have made CMakeLists of all darwin modules for building and using it on QtCreator.
2. Currently, I work on objDetection project as one of this framework projects.

For now this is really buggy, I will try and correct them

Darwin: A Framework for Machine Learning Research and Development
====

This is the main software repository for the Darwin machine learning
library. You probably want to get the latest version (master) or one
of the stable releases. To get the latest development version use one
of the following:

    git clone https://github.com/sgould/drwn.git darwin
    git clone git@github.com:sgould/drwn.git darwin
    svn co https://github.com/sgould/drwn darwin

Stable releases can be downloaded from
    http://github.com/sgould/drwn/releases/

If you have previously checked out code with "git clone" then you can
obtain the latest changes with:

    cd darwin; git pull

For further information see http://drwn.anu.edu.au/ or email
