This is my implementations under [darwin framework](http://drwn.anu.edu.au) for object detections. For more details please see the original repo.\n
My works include:
1. I have made CMakeLists of all darwin modules for building and using it on QtCreator.
2. Currently, I work on objDetection project as one of this framework projects.

For now this is really buggy, I will try and correct them
